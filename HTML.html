  <p> <strong>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for documents <br>
  designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies <br>
  such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript <br>
  ans VBScript. </P>

  <p> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and <br>
  render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes <br>
  the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for <br>
  the appearance of the document. </P>

  <p> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <br>
  images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into <br>
  the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting <br>
  structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, <br>
  quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <br>
  angle brackets. Tags such as (img /) and (input /)  directly introduce content <br>
  into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about <br>
  document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display <br>
  the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. </P>

  <p> HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, <br>
  which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines <br>
  the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), <br>
  former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, <br>
  has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. </P>
