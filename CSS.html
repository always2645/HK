    <p> <strong>CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, <br>
    including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve <br>
    content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the <br>
    specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages <br>
    to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, <br>
    and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. </p>

    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present <br>
    the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, <br>
    such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen <br>
    reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate <br>
    formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. </p>

    <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine <br>
    which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. <br>
    This cascading priority scheme is predictable. </p>

    <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). <br>
    Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS <br>
    by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS <br>
    documents. </p>
