  <p> <strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system <br>
  where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource <br>
  Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked <br>
  by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the <br>
  WWW are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed <br>
  by users by a software application called a web browser and are published <br>
  by a software application called a web server. </p>

  <p> English engineer and computer scientist Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee invented <br>
  the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed <br>
  at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, <br>
  first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and then to the <br>
  general public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to <br>
  the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people <br>
  use to interact on the Internet. </p>

  <p> Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext media <br>
  that have been formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Such formatting allows <br>
  for embedded hyperlinks that contain URLs and permit users to navigate to other <br>
  web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, <br>
  audio, and software components which are displayed in the user's web browser as coherent <br>
  pages of multimedia content. </p>
