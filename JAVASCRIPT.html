    <p> <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript <br>
    specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time <br>
    compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, <br>
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. </p>

    <p> Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. <br>
    JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. <br>
    The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all <br>
    major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. </p>

    <p> As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, <br>
    and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) <br>
    for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, <br>
    and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include <br>
    any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, <br>
    as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs. </p>

    <p> JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded <br>
    in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications <br>
    created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova </p>
